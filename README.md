## Abstract

This project is an evolving Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) tool designed to automate data collection, enrichment, analysis, and visualization. Currently, the tool focuses on domain, phone number, email, IP, and geolocation lookups through a combination of Abstract API, WHOIS lookup, and web scraping. The future roadmap includes a comprehensive set of features for investigators and analysts. The tool is built on Flask, providing a professional and user-friendly web application experience.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Current Functionality

- **Domain Lookup**: Obtain detailed information about a domain using Abstract API, WHOIS lookup, and web scraping techniques.
- **Phone Number Lookup**: Gather information related to a phone number through various online sources.
- **Email Lookup**: Retrieve details associated with an email address using Abstract API and web scraping.
- **IP and Geo Location Lookup**: Collect data about an IP address and its geographical location using Abstract API, WHOIS lookup, and web scraping.

### 2. Report Generation

- **PDF Report Download**: Generate and download detailed reports in PDF format for the information obtained.
